# How to run this project
I don't have any instructions, because I don't remeber how I set it all up. I have it configured locally with NetBeans 8.2.
If you want to run it locally, **create issue and I will try to help**.


# EraOfEidolon.com website
EraOfEidolon.com website points to this repository. 
Yes, I bought this domain, it was available... Over the years this domain was used for some shady stuff and gathered some bad reputation.
If server code could be reverse engineered, original game would work without any modifications.
